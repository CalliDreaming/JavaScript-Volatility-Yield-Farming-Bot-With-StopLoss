This is a decentralized yield farm bot that has a built in stop loss and monitors volatility in the market. everything is ran local on your machine using web 3 calls to engage in yield farms and monitor volatility. The minute downwards volatility is detected the bot will pull from the yield farm and buy into a stable coin that's pre-configured in the config.js file . You can change the settings in here if you wish to use a different stable coin. By default for the ETH Network it uses usdc, if you're using the bnb Network it's set for busd, if you're using the polygon at work it is set for the usdc on polygon. 
If you change the settings keep in mind you want to double check you're using the contract address of the correct stable coin on the network you selected.
